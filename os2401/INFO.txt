This is the directory for the experiment os2401, 
used for the Seminar conducted by Kriti Bhatia in winter semester 24/25.
Started: October 2024

This is a replication of Ganel et al. (2012, PLoS One). The aim is to investigate
if size resolution of actions like grasping is better than perception. We plan to 
also include manual estimation. The analysis will involve dichotomising the responses
from grasping and manual estimation and comparing accuracies in the grasping, manual
estimation and perceptual judgement tasks.
